**Technologies Used:**
Java 8
Java Console for the user interface
XAMPP server for local host and used to test before publishing remote server
My SQL for the database
**Steps to follow:**
Create the database table for Employees profiles using MySQL.
Develop the user interface using Java with the following functionalities:
Add a new employee profile
